# Summary Of Problem
## Origins of COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease that came to prominence after its first outbreak in the Wuhan province of China in December of 2019. Four months later on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization, declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then there have been over 1,000,000+ reported cases, and 50,000+ confirmed deaths globally. With reported cases in over 204 countries, this pandemic is forcing schools and businesses to close, economic insecurity, abrupt transition to remote work, isolation, stress on health care systems, and much more problems that cannot be enumerated. We at MPA have begun to list a wide array of problems with links so we can begin to get an idea of how we can tackle this problem from all perspectives. 

### Mitigation of Transmission

* Accomodating for influx of cases
* Racial Bias
### Law Enforcement
* Mass Surveillance
* Incarcerated Populations
* Enforcing Lockdown Laws
### Research/Chase for Cure
* Studying COVID gene
* Protein folding
* Artificial Intelligence
# Ideas and Resources
# Examples of Potential Solutions
Application that
* promotes activity while in quarantine

## Study This Hackathon
We at the Minority Programmers Association prioritize STEM education, believing that it is the key to upward mobility in the 21st century.  We believe in the efficacy of project-based learning, group-learning, interdisciplinary teamwork, where the students use their passion as their primary motivation. If you are a data scientist, professor, or a student interested in collecting data regarding how the principles impact the software development process, contact Jack V, Education Specialist,  jack@minorityprogrammers.org. We believe this particular Hackathon is interesting as it faces the challenge of both remote work and individual social distancing of the team. 
## Become A Resource
We need live TAs that can host sessions on Zoom/Discord/Twitch  to facilitate questions that participants may have. We believe that competition should also create an ability to teach others different technologies and we hope to build a rich live community of online resources from across the world.
## Share with Community
If you are not competing you can also help the race to stop COVID-19 in its track in a through many means including.
* Sharing this hackathon flyer on social media
* Providing feedback in our chats/forums throughout
* Helping the Minority Programmers to organize this event
