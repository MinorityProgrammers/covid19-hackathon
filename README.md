# Summary Of Problem
## Origins of COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease that came to prominence after its first outbreak in the Wuhan province of China in December of 2019. Four months later on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization, declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then there have been over 1,000,000+ reported cases, and 50,000+ confirmed deaths globally. With reported cases in over 204 countries, this pandemic is forcing schools and businesses to close, economic insecurity, abrupt transition to remote work, isolation, stress on health care systems, and much more problems that cannot be enumerated. We at MPA have begun to list a wide array of problems with links so we can begin to get an idea of how we can tackle this problem from all perspectives.
